# Predicting_Credit_Risk_ML_Challenge
Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk. The end goal is to build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

Use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
